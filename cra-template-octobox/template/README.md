# Getting Started
Run `npm start`.
### Note
This framework is very much in development, and is subject to change at any time. Do not expect this to work *yet*.

~~Stylelint currently does not work due it requiring postcss 8 while other dependencies in this framework require postcss 7.~~ This has been fixed! If you're trying to use IDEA's Stylelint integration, however, it will not work. This is a bug with IDEA and will be fixed with 2021.2.4 as per https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-53225. I'll continue to update this message until all issues with Stylelint are resolved.
