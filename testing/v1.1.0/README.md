# Getting Started
Welcome to your Octobox app! We recommend running one of the scripts below to get started:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**\
Exposes every configuration file of the project. There will be a lot of new files. Run with caution.

### `npm run serve`
Hosts a prebuilt Octobox binary using `serve`.\
You can host a production version of your app using this command.

### `npm run deploy`
Builds and serves your application.\
If you're implementing a CD workflow, use this command.
