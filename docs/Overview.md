# Overview
Octobox is a React meta-framework for building comprehensive apps with Typescript. It exists to solve one problem: the lack of client-side features from SSR frameworks existing in a client-side framework. SSR frameworks like Next.js and Remix have a lot of great features like filesystem routing, data loading, form handling, and others which can work client-side, but client-side frameworks boasting these features don't really exist for React. Octobox attempts to bridge this gap by bringing these features to client-side React apps while offering SSR-like prerendering for the best of both worlds.
